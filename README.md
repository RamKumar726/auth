# **Project Title: AuthShield: A Secure Role-Based Access Control System**  



# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System for VRV Security

## 1. Introduction

This project implements a secure **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system for authentication and authorization, aligning with VRV Securityâ€™s commitment to building robust cybersecurity solutions. RBAC ensures that access to resources is granted based on user roles, minimizing the risks associated with unauthorized access.

The system includes features like:
- User registration and login
- Secure token-based session management
- Role-based access restrictions  

By employing best practices, this project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of authentication, authorization, and RBAC principles, vital for secure and scalable backend systems.

## 2. Objectives

The primary objectives of the project are:

1. **Authentication**: Build a secure mechanism to validate users and grant access through JWT tokens.
2. **Authorization**: Ensure users can only access resources or perform actions allowed by their roles.
3. **Role-Based Access Control**: Design a system where roles (e.g., Admin, HOD, and Student) dictate permissions, ensuring fine-grained control.
4. **Secure Implementation**: Follow security best practices, including password hashing, token expiration, and structured API responses.

### User Roles & Hierarchy:
- **Admin**: Manages HODs and oversees the system.
- **HOD (Head of Department)**: Manages students within their department.
- **Student**: Can access personal profile information.

## 3. Implementation

### 3.1 Technologies Used:
- **Backend Framework**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas with Mongoose for schema modeling
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management
- **Encryption**: Password hashing with `bcryptjs`

### 3.2 Key Features:
1. **User Registration**:
   - Allows users to register with attributes like username, email, password, role, and department.
   - Validates unique email addresses.
2. **User Login**:
   - Authenticates user credentials and generates a secure JWT token upon successful login.
3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Middleware to restrict access based on user roles.
   - Example: Admins can view HOD details and their department's students, while HODs can only view students in their department.
4. **Secure Password Storage**:
   - Passwords are hashed using `bcrypt` for secure database storage.
5. **Token-Based Authentication**:
   - JWT tokens are issued upon login and verified during subsequent API requests.
